# Development Plan for CLI Tool

## Checklist

### Step 1: Setup Development Environment

- [x] Initialize Your Project
  - Create a new directory for your CLI project.
  - Initialize a Node.js project with `npm init`.
  - Set up a Git repository with `git init`.
- [ ] Configure Basic Project Structure
  - Set up directories for your source code, tests, and documentation.
- [ ] Install Essential Libraries
  - Install `commander` or another CLI framework to handle command parsing.
  - Add testing libraries (`jest`) for unit tests and mocking.

### Step 2: Define CLI Functionality and Commands

- [ ] Outline the CLI Commands and Options
  - Determine the commands needed (e.g., `init`, `add-component`, `setup-auth`).
  - Define the options and arguments for each command.
- [ ] Start Coding the Basic CLI Framework
  - Use `commander` to define the skeleton of your CLI commands.
  - Implement help and version commands as starters.

### Step 3: Implement Command Functionalities

- [ ] Setup Command for New Projects
  - Code the logic to set up a new SvelteKit project, incorporating the latest packages.
  - Automate the addition of Prisma, Supabase, TailwindCSS, and DaisyUI.
- [ ] Authentication Setup Command
  - Implement automated scripts to configure authentication using a preferred method or service.

### Step 4: Integrate GitHub Automation

- [ ] Automate Repository Creation
  - Use the GitHub API to create a new repository when a project is initialized.
  - Automatically push the initial commit.
- [ ] Simplify Git Operations
  - Create a script or command that checks for errors, stages files, and commits with a provided message.

### Step 5: Develop Component Management

- [ ] Create a Component Repository on GitHub
  - Establish a repository to store reusable Svelte components.
- [ ] Implement Component Addition and Retrieval Commands
  - Develop commands that allow users to add to or fetch components from the repository directly via the CLI.

### Step 6: Automate Theme and Styling Setup

- [ ] Standardize TailwindCSS and DaisyUI Setup
  - Code scripts that automatically configure these libraries in every new project.

### Step 7: Testing and Quality Assurance

- [ ] Write Unit Tests
  - Use Jest to write tests for each CLI command and functionality.
  - Mock external calls and file system operations to ensure tests are isolated and repeatable.
- [ ] Set Up Continuous Integration
  - Configure GitHub Actions to run your test suite on every push and pull request.

### Step 8: Documentation and Release

- [ ] Document Each Command and Its Use
  - Create a clear and concise README and other documentation files explaining how to install and use the CLI.
- [ ] Prepare for Release
  - Package the CLI tool and publish it on npm to make it accessible to others.
- [ ] Gather Feedback and Iterate
  - Encourage user feedback and continuously improve the tool based on user needs and experiences.

## Next Steps in Development

### 1. Start Coding the Core Functionality

- Begin by implementing the basic functionality in the `src/index.js` file, serving as the entry point of your CLI application.
- Populate the `src/commands/` directory with modules for each CLI command you plan to support, such as `init`, `add-component`, or `setup-auth`.
- Utilize the `src/utils/` directory for helper functions that can be shared across different commands, like file manipulation, API calls, or configuration handling.

### 2. Write Initial Command and Utility Tests

- Start adding tests in the `tests/command-tests/` and `tests/util-tests/` directories.
- Ensure tests cover basic expected functionality and edge cases. Using Jest can simplify mocking dependencies and checking outcomes.

### 3. Documentation

- Begin documenting each part of the CLI as you develop.
  - `setup.md`: Guide users on how to install and configure your CLI tool.
  - `usage.md`: Provide detailed examples of each command and option available.
  - `examples.md`: Showcase common workflows or complex scenarios where your CLI can be useful.

### 4. Version Control Integration

- Ensure your `.gitignore` file is correctly set up to exclude `node_modules/` and any other unnecessary files.
- Regularly commit your changes to Git to keep track of your development progress. Use branches to manage different features.

### 5. Testing Automation and CI/CD

- Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or another tool. This will automate testing and ensure your code is always deployable.
- Automate tests to run on every commit or pull request to catch issues early.

### 6. Development Plan Updates

- Keep the `DevelopmentPlanForCLI.md` updated as your project evolves. This document should reflect any new decisions or changes in your project scope and serve as a roadmap.

## Keeping the Momentum

- Regularly Review and Refactor: As your project grows, review your code for improvements and opportunities to keep the codebase clean and maintainable.
- Engage with Potential Users: Get feedback from potential users early and often to guide development according to real-world needs.
- Iterative Development: Continue developing in small, manageable iterations, adding features and making adjustments based on testing and feedback.
